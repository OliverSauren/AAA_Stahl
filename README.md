# AAA_Stahl
This is the git-repository of Team Stahl.
For each task we created one jupyter notebook (respective task number as on the team assignment sheet). 
We needed some extra dataframes which are stored in the folder "extra_dataframes". In "requirements.txt" you can find all the relevant third-party libraries to run the notebooks.
Order of executing notebooks: 
* 1_weather_data.ipynb
* 1_taxitrip_cleanup.ipynb
* 2_Descriptive_Analytics.ipynb
* 3_Clustering_main.ipynb
* 3_Clustering_POI.ipynb
* 4_SVM_regression.ipynb
* 4_Deep_Learning.ipynb
* 5_reinforcement_learning.ipynb
